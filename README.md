# ScanCervixCancer

Cervical cancer is an ongoing major global health challenge, highlighting the importance of precise and effective diagnostic techniques. Here, a novel detection system for cervical cell type classification is introduced based on the Herlev Pap smear dataset, offering microscopic resolution in seven varying categories. Unlike typical methods, the current work utilizes Non-Local Means (NLM) filtering for noise attenuation without disturbing fine details, supporting high-quality input for training models. Data augmentation techniques are used further to improve the diversity and stability of the dataset. A new addition of Dilated Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DSPP) creates gaps among f ilter elements so that an extended receptive field can be achieved without adding more parameters. Deep convolutional neural networks facilitate extensive multiscale feature enhancement and f ine-grained classification. The integration of feature enhance ment through DSPP, optimization in the framework achieved higher accuracy and Consistency than traditional techniques. This paper not only highlights the significance of accurate cervical cancer detection and dataset analysis but also offers a scalable solution for the development of automated screening in clinical applications.
